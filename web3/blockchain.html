        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        
        <p>
          So, what is a blockchain?
        </p>

        <p><i>this page is a work in progress, as I learn more about what a blockchain is, I'm going to write it down here, maybe it will save you time.</i></p>

        <hr>

        
        <p>
          A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized and immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a peer-to-peer network. 
          <br><br>
          Transactions are recorded in a block, which is a basically a container for data.
          <br><br>
          Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous, recording all transactions and making hacking almost impossible.  The sequence of blocks is referred to as the <b>chain</b>.
          <br><br>
          Each participant in the blockchain network holds a copy of the entire ledger, so no single entity owns it.
          <br><br>
          Having no central authority controlling the ledger is what makes a blockchain appealing and gives it additional trust and authority.
          <br><br>
          The first block on the bitcoin blockchain was the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">genesis block</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Blocks</h3>
        <p>
          Each block contains:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transaction data: Information about transactions (e.g., sender, receiver, amount).
          </li>
          <li>
            Timestamp: The time at which the block was created.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hash: A unique digital fingerprint of the block’s data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Previous block’s hash: This links the block to the preceding one, forming a chain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chain</h3>
        <p>
          Blocks are linked together in a linear, chronological order. Once a block is added, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, ensuring data integrity.
        </p>

        <h3>Nodes</h3>
        <p>
          Computers in the blockchain network are known as nodes. Each node has a full copy of the blockchain. Nodes work together to validate new blocks.
        </p>

        <h3>Consensus mechanism</h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain networks use different methods for participants to agree on the validity of new blocks, ensuring they are legitimate. Common consensus mechanisms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Proof of Work (PoW)</b>: Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Proof of Stake (PoS)</b>: Validators stake a portion of their cryptocurrency to gain the right to validate transactions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Blockchain Works</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>A transaction occurs</b>: Let's say Alice sends Bob some cryptocurrency. This transaction is represented as data and broadcast to the blockchain network.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transaction verification</b>: Nodes (computers) in the network verify the transaction using cryptographic algorithms to ensure that Alice has enough balance and that the transaction follows the network's rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transaction added to a block</b>: After verification, the transaction is bundled with other transactions into a new block.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Consensus</b>: The network's nodes use a consensus mechanism (e.g., PoW or PoS) to agree that the new block is valid. Once a consensus is reached, the block is added to the blockchain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Block added to the chain</b>: The newly validated block is permanently added to the blockchain. Each block has a reference (hash) to the previous block, forming a chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transaction confirmed</b>: The transaction between Alice and Bob is now part of the blockchain, and both can see it on the ledger. This record cannot be altered.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Questions</h2>

        <h3>How does a participant or node join a blockchain?</h3>
        <p>
          Basically any computer on the internet can become a node. The easiest way is to download the bitcoin core software, which would first download a full copy of the blockchain, which at the time of writing stands around 600 GB and is then ready to start receiving transactions and validating blocks. Here is a good resource explaining the steps: <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/networking/node/" target="_blank">learnmeabitcoin.com</a>.  


        </p>

        <h3>A node is connected to some other nodes, how is the nodes it is assigned to decided?</h3>

        <p>There are three options that Bitcoin Core uses to find other nodes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Previous Connections. Bitcoin Core maintains a list of nodes it has previously connected to, and tries connecting to those again once it starts up.
          </li>
          <li>
            DNS Seeds. If you're running Bitcoin Core for the first time, you won't have a database of previous nodes, so it will use DNS Seeds like the ones above to find nodes to connect to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hardcoded List. If all else fails, Bitcoin Core comes with a hard-coded list of "Seed Nodes" it will connect to and use as a starting point to help it find other nodes on the network. This list can be found in chainparamsseeds.h.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Where is bitcoin (and others) source code?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" target="_blank">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin</a></li>
          <li>https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who is the creator of Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>
          No one really knows who the creator is, there are some theories but many of them deny being Satoshi Nakamoto, here is a good article from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto-the-creator-of-bitcoin" target="_blank">cointelegraph</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How does someone get an address on the blockchain</h3>
        <p>An address on the blockchain is derived from a private key, a private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/guide/keys-addresses/" target="_blank">https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/guide/keys-addresses/</a></p>

        <h3>What is the 12 or 24 word mnemonic seed?</h3>
        <p>
          In a series of steps the mnemonic seed can be converted to the private key, so remembering the 12 word mnemonic is as good as remembering the private key.  The steps are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Convert the mnemonic to a 512-bit seed using a key derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or BIP39</li>
          <li>Convert the seed to a 256-bit master key using an HD key generation algorithm, such as BIP32</li>
          <li>Convert the master Key to private key using an HD key derivation algorithm, such as BIP32 or BIP44</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that it's not possible to use a private key to generate a 12-word mnemonic.  Either you generate a private key or a generator will provide you with a 12-word mnemonic.
        </p>

        <h3>What is mining?</h3>
        <p>
          A competition across the network to hash a candidate block so the resulting hash is below a target number.  The target number can change to control how quickly/slowly (or how hard it is) to find a hash.
          <br><br>
          If a node successfully finds a hash first, they submit it to the rest of the network and can claim a reward for their efforts.
        </p>
        <h3>How do transactions make it into the block?</h3>
        <p>
          When a transaction is created it is submitted to a node and then gets propagated throughout the network from node-to-node.  The transactions are stored in each node's memory pool, ready to be included in the candidates block and eventually a block on the blockchain.
          <br><br>
          The network resolves conflicting transactions by rejecting any transactions in a memory pool that conflicts with one already written into a block.
          <br><br>
          Transactions in the memory pool can be removed for other reasons as well:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>when it is successfully mined</li>
          <li>replaced with a transaction with higher fee</li>
          <li>expiration after 2 weeks</li>
          <li>size limit - 300 MB, if the size limit is reached the transaction with the lowest fee is removed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The maximum size of a block is 4,000,000 weight units.
        </p>

        <h3>What are layers</h3>

        <p>
          Today, in 2024, the blockchain/crypto industry is maturing and multiple layers of the technology have formed to allow improved experiences and reduce issues with scalability and transaction fees:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            layer 0 protocol - allow cross chain exchange of data and/or value
            <ul>
              <li>include <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-v1" target="_blank">Polkadot (https://polkadot.com/)</a></li>
              <li>Wanchain</li>
              <li>Cosmos SDK</li>
            </ul>
            
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 1 - basic primary blockchain network e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, solana
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 2- helps scale L1
              <ul>
                <li>what is base by coinbase - https://www.bankrate.com/investing/base-by-coinbase/</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          NOTES / TODOs:
        </p>

        <pre>
custodial vs non-custodial - coinbase exchange vs coinbase wallet
with non-custodial, you own your private key
On-ramp vs Off-ramps
what are Roll-ups
smart contracts - recurring payments using smart contacts?
51% attacks
Why does it matter?
