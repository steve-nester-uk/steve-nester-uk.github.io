        <p>
          So, what is a blockchain?
        </p>

        <p><i>this page is a work in progress, as I learn more about what a blockchain is, I'm going to write it down here, maybe it will save you time.</i></p>

        <p>
          A blockchain is a distributed open ledger where each block is cryptographically linked to the previous, recording all transactions and making hacking almost impossible.

          The first block on the blockchain was the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">genesis block</a>.

          <br>

          As new transactions happen they get written to the blockchain by miners.

          Today, in 2024, the blockchain/crypto industry is maturing and multiple layers of the technology have formed to allow improved experiences and reduce issues with scalability and transaction fees:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            layer 0 protocol - allow cross chain exchange of data and/or value
            <ul>
              <li>include <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-v1" target="_blank">Polkadot (https://polkadot.com/)</a></li>
              <li>Wanchain</li>
              <li>Cosmos SDK</li>
            </ul>
            
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 1 - basic primary blockchain network e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, solana
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 2- helps scale L1
              <ul>
                <li>what is base by coinbase - https://www.bankrate.com/investing/base-by-coinbase/</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          NOTES / TODOs:
        </p>

        <pre>
custodial vs non-custodial - coinbase exchange vs coinbase wallet
with non-custodial, you own your private key
On-ramp vs Off-ramps
what are Roll-ups
smart contracts
51% attacks
Why does it matter?
