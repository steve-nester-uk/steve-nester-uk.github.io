          So I start looking into crypto technology a few years ago but put it on hold after trying to get a .eth address from ENS only to find it would cost a ton in 'gas fees'.  Well, the world has evolved since then so I decided to take another look.  I'll update this page with my findings and interesting resources.

          So, what is a blockchain?
        </p>
        <p>
          A blockchain is a distributed open ledger where each block is cryptographically linked to the previous, recording all transactions and making hacking almost impossible.

          The first block on the blockchain was the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">genesis block</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, in 2024, the blockchain/crypto industry is maturing and multiple layers of the technology have formed to allow improved experiences and reduce issues with scalability and transaction fees:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            layer 0 protocol - allow cross chain exchange of data and/or value
            - include Polkadot (https://polkadot.com/) / https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadot-v1, Wanchain, Cosmos SDK
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gAmSpYDFKE
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 1 - basic primary blockchain network e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, solana
          </li>
          <li>
            layer 2- helps scale L1
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          custodial vs non-custodial - coinbase exchange vs coinbase wallet

          with non-custodial, you own your private key
        </p>

        <p>
          On-ramp vs Off-ramps
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does it matter?
        </p>
